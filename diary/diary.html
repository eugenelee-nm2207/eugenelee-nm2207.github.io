      </th>
      <td>The Kpop Industry is a rather competitive one, with new groups forming, and much content being generated, every year. 
        While there are definitely many factors that could contribute to a group's success, a common question, is if Male Kpop idols would tend to do better than female idols.
      <br><br> While the gender split amongst Kpop idols is roughly equal <a href = "https://medium.com/swlh/exploratory-data-of-k-pop-idols-8693b44ac312#:~:text=There%20are%20208%20K%2Dpop%20groups%20in%20total.,promoting%20in%20non%2DKorean%20languages">(Rahmi, 2021)</a>,
          the gender split of fans is slightly more skewed, at about 7 Female : 3 Male (check out the Data Story!).
      <br><br> Traditionally, it is assumed that male Kpop idols would meet with more success as they would appeal to more female fans. 
              However, is this backed by actual statistics? Furthermore, today, girl groups have begun targeting the female fanbase, with themes of female empowerment.
      <br><br> Through my data story, I will endeavour to explore this.

<p>
  <mark>Firstly, here is the <a href="resources/Eugene-Lee-Week9-Submission.pdf">PDF</a> containing the concepts from class that I have used in my Final Project so far.</mark>
  <br><br>Initially, <a href="https://nm2207.org/2223S2/e0725630/web/project/week7idea/index.html">this</a> was my project idea!
  However, I decided to change my topic from an analysis of Blackpink's growth, to a more general investigation on <strong>whether gender may play a part in Kpop Idols' success</strong>. 
  I felt that I would have more data to work with, and the implications of my study may potentially be useful in the study of both the Kpop phenomenon, and even in gender studies.
  <br>
  <br> The data I plan to use can be found in my Story Board!
  <br><br> To come up with the layout of the website for my data story, I followed 2 YouTube tutorials: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-PEhxtC58Q">this for the popout navigation pane</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdrbE-s5DgQ&ab_channel=WebDevCreative">this for the top navigation bar</a>. I combined what I liked from both together!
  <br> Here's how it looked like when I first started out:
  <br><img src="resources/makingTopNavBar.png" class="documentation" width="400px">
  <br> As you can see, the top navigation bar was initially separate from the links, as I wanted to use it for navigating through the data story page. I then decided the side popout bar would be a better fit, and put the links into the top navigation bar so that they could be used to navigate between the data story and other aspects of my submission!
  <br><br> Another interesting thing I learnt was how to <a href="-	https://gist.github.com/Sneakingrocky/c89c9d6fe5df543c6100">add highlight to a text via Javascript</a>., which I utilized in the Introduction section of my Data Story.
  <br>

<h3 id="headerW10">Progress (Week 10)</h3>
<p>
  Started off this week by beginning to add my references to the Data Story. I learnt how to add the hanging indent for APA citations from <a href="https://resilienteducator.com/instructional-design/hanging-indents-in-html-and-css-for-instructional-designers/">this website</a>.
