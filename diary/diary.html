      </th>
      <td>The Kpop Industry is a rather competitive one, with new groups forming, and much content being generated, every year. While there are definitely many factors that could contribute to a group's success, a common question, is if Male Kpop idols would tend to do better than female idols.
        While the gender split amongst Kpop idols is roughly equal  <a href = "https://medium.com/swlh/exploratory-data-of-k-pop-idols-8693b44ac312#:~:text=There%20are%20208%20K%2Dpop%20groups%20in%20total.,promoting%20in%20non%2DKorean%20languages">(Rahmi, 2021)</a>,
        the gender split of fans is slightly more skewed, at about 7 Female : 3 Male (check out the Data Story!).Traditionally, Kpop male idol groups dominated physical album sales (because female fans are more “committed”), while female groups tended to match up better in online streaming and downloads (Yoon 2022) by appealing to the general public.      <br><br> Traditionally, it is assumed that male Kpop idols would meet with more success as they would appeal to more female fans. 
        Today, Kpop girl groups have begun targeting the newer generation, with newer concepts emphasizing, and even commodifying, the theme of female empowerment and breaking stereotypes (Sun, Paje & Lee, 2021; to Zhang et al., 2022).      <br><br> Through my data story, I will endeavour to explore this.

<h3 id="headerW9">Progress (Till Week 9)</h3>
<p>
  <mark>Firstly, here is the <a href="resources/Eugene-Lee-Week9-Submission.pdf">PDF</a> containing the concepts from class that I have used in my Final Project so far.</mark>
  <br><br>Initially, <a href="https://nm2207.org/2223S2/e0725630/web/project/week7idea/index.html">this</a> was my project idea!
  However, I decided to change my topic from an analysis of Blackpink's growth, to a more general investigation on <strong>whether gender may play a part in Kpop Idols' success</strong>. 
  I felt that I would have more data to work with, and the implications of my study may potentially be useful in the study of both the Kpop phenomenon, and even in gender studies.
  <br>
  <br> The data I plan to use can be found in my Story Board!
  <br><br> To come up with the layout of the website for my data story, I followed 2 YouTube tutorials: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-PEhxtC58Q">this for the popout navigation pane</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdrbE-s5DgQ&ab_channel=WebDevCreative">this for the top navigation bar</a>. I combined what I liked from both together! Here's how it looked like when I first started out:
  <br><img src="resources/makingTopNavBar.png" class="documentation" width="400px">
  <br> As you can see, the top navigation bar was initially separate from the links, as I wanted to use it for navigating through the data story page. I then decided the side popout bar would be a better fit, and put the links into the top navigation bar so that they could be used to navigate between the data story and other aspects of my submission!
  <br><br> Another interesting thing I learnt was how to <a href="-	https://gist.github.com/Sneakingrocky/c89c9d6fe5df543c6100">add highlight to a text via Javascript</a>., which I utilized in the Introduction section of my Data Story.

      <br>Why is this an important question? </th>
      <br><td>
      Traditionally, Kpop male idol groups dominated physical album sales, while female groups tended to match up better in online streaming and downloads (Yoon 2022), but these may be changing. 
      <br><br>Increasingly, it has been brought to light that marketing strategies for women in Kpop face discrimination in terms of agency, over-sexualization and compartmentalization in gender roles that male idols are much less restricted by (Jonas, 2021), in order to appeal to the male gaze.
      <br><br>As such, today, Kpop girl groups have begun targeting the newer generation, with newer concepts emphasizing, and even commodifying, the theme of female empowerment and breaking stereotypes (Sun, Paje & Lee, 2021; to Zhang et al., 2022).
      <br><br>This study will explore preliminarily if this strategy is proving successful.

      <br>Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question? </th>

      As there is no large central dataset online for Kpop idols, I had to construct my own dataset, as attached here. I was able to collect data on 3 broad categories: physical album sales, digital streams, and market brand reputation scores. 
      <br><br>However, I decided not to include (filtered out) data on any Korean singers who were not a Kpop group, to simplify the process, as there can be many ambiguities regarding whether certain artists, in particular soloists, could be counted as Kpop idols. 
      <br><br>In my current excel file, the data is classified into a few sheets. I will probably split them up into individual CSV files for use with my code.

  <p>Started off this week by beginning to add my references to the Data Story. I learnt how to add the hanging indent for APA citations from <a href="https://resilienteducator.com/instructional-design/hanging-indents-in-html-and-css-for-instructional-designers/">this website</a>.</p>
  <p>Thereafter, I faced some difficulty envisioning the flow and aim of my data story. In particular, it was difficult for me to answer question 2 (why my data story answers an important question). I took some time to do some literature review, and to plan out the rationale and content flow of my data story, which I am satisfied with. I will be implementing the changes in my data story subsequently.</p>
  <p>I also took the time to firm up my data set. One problem with not having a large data base online (unlike for topics like world happiness etc) was that I had to make my own data set, which proved arduous. A lot of manual entry and data filtering was done (so that I did not have to key in pointless data) and my computer even crashed a few times! </p>
  
  <h3 id="headerW11">Progress (Week 11)</h3>
  <p>
    First off, I will list down the answers to the Week 11 question - In the physical and digital data segments, I will likely use: 
    <ul>
      <li>bar charts for datasets with many data points</li>
      <li>pie charts for summaries of male vs female Kpop groups </li>
      <li>bubble chart for youtube views (3 dimensions: year released, total views and views growth)</li>
    </ul>
    The data I will use to make these charts can be found in the week 10 diary entry. 
    <br> Something interesting I might be able to try, would be in the analysis of the top 5 boy vs girl groups in terms of market branding. I was thinking of using radar charts to show their performance in different domains (physical sales, digital sales etc). 
    
    <br><br> This week, I started constructing some of the graphs. Starting with the first section of “Physical sales”, I exported the first set of data to CSV.
    I first used the sort function to arrange the data as desired (highest male and female album sales towards the middle):
    <br> <img src="resources/screenshots/using-sort-function.png" width="200px">
    <br> I successfully managed to use the fetch method to import my CSV file to the code. This was necessary because there were quite a few data points for this set of data. However, one issue I consistently faced was not being able to easily visualize how I wanted to manipulate the data and what I should do to make a graph that I desired.
  
    <br><br> In particular, I wanted to colour the male and female bars in different colours, by using the index position of the data (<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbjuWAtDROY&ab_channel=ChartJS">this tutorial</a>) but the code broke. 
    <br><img src="resources/screenshots/color-index-not-working.png" height="500px" width="450px">
    <br> Instead, I referred to <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp">good ol W3schools</a> and used the if else function to create the large array of colours needed to colour the graph. 
    <br><br> To create an alternate view of the data (only one album per unique group), I used this <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK4u0C9v6AI&t=10s&ab_channel=ChartJS">youtube tutorial</a> to revise the process of using chart.update. 
    <br><br> Lastly, I also did up the code that generates the top 5 favourite Kpop groups in 7 different countries (complements the map chart under digital sales). Here, I used the “else if” method that I had learnt along with for loops.
  </p>

  <h3 id="headerW12">Progress (Week 12)</h3>
  <p>
    Firstly, I updated the <a href="#headerIntroduction">story board</a>!
    <br><br>This week, I followed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxf_GEiryoc&ab_channel=ChartJS">youtube video</a> to learn how to easily have multiple charts side by side in nicely formatted boxes. 
    <br>I also figured out I could input the border colours of the bar chart into excel, and extract them as an array using the fetch function, to easily use it under backgroundColor to colour the bars according to gender.
    <br><img src="resources/screenshots/excel-color.png" height="500px" width="450px">
    
    <br><br> Next, I followed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyWcp3GOeeE&ab_channel=ChartJS">youtube tutorial</a> to learn how to convert arrays into the data structure necessary to construct scatter charts
    <br><br> I then tried using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44661671/chart-js-scatter-chart-displaying-label-specific-to-point-in-tooltip"this forum's></a> suggestions to add labels to the individual points, but for some reason, every point was getting labelled with every label in the array! I will need more time to fix this. 
    <br>I was also unable to use the same method of colouring the dots, that I used for the bar charts.
